# IzerRaster

IzerRaster is a hybrid CPU/GPU rasterizer for 3D models and 2D shapes, supporting interactive input and high-performance CUDA-accelerated rendering. It projects 3D models onto a 2D surface (the computer screen) and provides a flexible API for both drawing and input handling.

## CUDA Rasterization

- **initCuda(width, height):**  
  Allocates GPU buffers for color and depth, configures optimal thread blocks.
- **renderFrame(tris, numTris, hostPix, hostDepth):**  
  Runs the full GPU pipeline: clears buffers, rasterizes triangles with depth testing, copies results to CPU.
- **cleanupCuda():**  
  Frees all GPU memory and resets device pointers.

**Performance:**  
- Scales with triangle count and resolution.
- Uses one thread per pixel for maximum parallelism.
- CPU prepares triangle data, GPU rasterizes, CPU overlays wireframes and handles input.

---

## Input Handling

- **Event Types:**  
  - Keyboard: `KEYUP`, `KEYDOWN`
  - Mouse: `MOUSEUP`, `MOUSEDOWN`, `MOUSEWHEEL`, `MOUSEMOTION`
- **Custom Handlers:**  
  Register Python callbacks for specific events.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  def on_key(event):
      if event.key == 'ESCAPE':
          quit()
  registerInputHandler('KEYDOWN', on_key)
  ```

---

## Error Handling

- All CUDA calls are checked for errors; exceptions are raised on failure.
- Graceful fallback to CPU rendering if GPU memory allocation fails.
- Input and file loading errors are reported with descriptive messages.

---

## Extensibility

- **Planned Features:**  
  - Texture mapping (UV support)
  - Per-vertex color and lighting
  - Custom shaders (GLSL/CUDA)
  - Anti-aliasing and post-processing
  - Scene graph and camera controls
- **Modular Design:**  
  - Add new rendering modes or input devices with minimal changes.
  - Extend Python API via Pybind11.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build fails:**  
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed and on your PATH.
  - For CUDA errors, check your GPU driver and CUDA toolkit version.
- **No display/output:**  
  - Verify SDL3 is installed and working.
  - Run with `python3 -m pdb main.py` for debugging.
- **Python import errors:**  
  - Ensure the `.so`/`.pyd` file is in the `src/` directory.
