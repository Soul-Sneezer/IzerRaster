# IzerRaster
IzerRaster is a rasterizer. What is a rasterizer? A rasterizer takes 3D models and projects them to a 2D surface, that 2D surface being the computer screen.

# Trello

We used Trello in order to manage and organise our tasks during the development of the application. This is the [link](https://trello.com/b/ZR0p4Yfg/rasterizer) to our backlog creation.

# User stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

User1: As a Blender enthusiast, I want to import 3D models in common file formats so I can load and convert my designs without hassle.

User2: As a designer, I want to set the output resolution myself so I can ensure my images meet quality standards for client work.

User3: As a lighting artist, I want to tweak lighting settings so my rasterized scenes look dynamic and eye-catching.

User4: As a 3D animator, I want to switch between rendering modes to experiment with different visual styles for my portfolio.

User5: As a 3D enthusiast, I want to have simple command for different drawing shapes and have them displayed in a buffer for convenience.

User6: As a shader developer, I want to apply custom GLSL/HLSL shaders to add unique textures and effects to my models.

User7: As a virtual photographer, I want to adjust the cameraâ€™s position, angle, and zoom to frame my 3D scenes perfectly for renders.

User8: As a detail-focused tester, I want anti-aliasing enabled to eliminate jagged edges and ensure my final images look polished.

User9: As a freelancer with tight deadlines, I want a back face culling option before committing to a full render.

User10: As a game developer, I want GPU acceleration support to speed up rendering for complex models and large projects.

User11: As a newbie to 3D software, I want an intuitive interface with helpful tooltips so I can learn the app without getting overwhelmed.
