# IzerRaster
IzerRaster is a rasterizer. What is a rasterizer? A rasterizer takes 3D models and projects them to a 2D surface, that 2D surface being the computer screen.

# Trello

We used Trello in order to manage and organise our tasks during the development of the application. This is the [link](https://trello.com/b/ZR0p4Yfg/rasterizer) to our backlog creation.

# User stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

1. As a Blender enthusiast, and I want to import 3D models in common file formats so I can load and convert my designs without hassle.

2. As a designer, and I want to set the output resolution myself so I can ensure my images meet quality standards for client work.

3. As a lighting artist, and I want to tweak lighting settings so my rasterized scenes look dynamic and eye-catching.

4. As a 3D animator, and I want to switch between rendering modes to experiment with different visual styles for my portfolio.

5. As a content creator, and I want to export images in standard formats so I can share my work directly on social media or design platforms."

6. As a shader developer, and I want to apply custom GLSL/HLSL shaders to add unique textures and effects to my models.

7. As a virtual photographer, and I want to adjust the cameraâ€™s position, angle, and zoom to frame my 3D scenes perfectly for renders.

8. As a detail-focused tester, and I want anti-aliasing enabled to eliminate jagged edges and ensure my final images look polished.

9. As a freelancer with tight deadlines, and I want a low-res preview option to test ideas quickly before committing to a full render.

10. As a game developer, and I want GPU acceleration support to speed up rendering for complex models and large projects.

11. As a newbie to 3D software, and I want an intuitive interface with helpful tooltips so I can learn the app without getting overwhelmed.
