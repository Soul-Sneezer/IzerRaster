# IzerRaster
IzerRaster is a rasterizer. What is a rasterizer? A rasterizer takes 3D models and projects them to a 2D surface, that 2D surface being the computer screen.

Currently the library has two main features: 
- it can load and render 3D models and basic 2D shapes(triangles, rectangles, circles)
- it can handle input events from the mouse or keyboard

The IzerRaster library has a core loop, named UserUpdate(), that runs once per frame. And a UserInit() function, which runs right after the basic Init() function that initializes everything. The user should override the "UserUpdate", "UserInit" function when defining the renderer class.

The drawing/rendering and input handling functions should be called from UserUpdate.

In order to render an object you need to:
- Load the object, using the _loadObj_ function. It takes a path as argument, and can only load .obj files. It then returns a _mesh_ object
- You can then modify the _mesh_ object using the _applyRenderMatrix_ function, which takes 2 arguments: a render matrix and a mesh
- Then you render the object using the _drawObj_ and passing the mesh as an argument
  
**IzerRaster** also has a few drawing functions:
- *drawPoint* - takes 3 arguments, the first is the X coordinate, the second is the Y coordinate and the last one is the color in RGBA format
- *drawLine* - takes 5 arguments, the first two are the X,Y coordinates of the first point of the line, then the X,Y coordinates of the second point of the line, and the color
- *drawRect* - takes 5 arguments, the first two are the X,Y coordinates of the lower left corner point, the following two are the X,Y coordinates of the upper right corner point, and then the color
- *drawTriangle* - takes 7 arguments, the first six are coordinates of the points that describe the triangle: X1,Y1, X2,Y2, X3,Y3, the last one is the color 
- *drawCircle* - takes 4 arguments, the first two are the X,Y coordinates of the center of the triangle, then the radius and lastly, the color

For almost every drawing function(with the exception of *drawPoint* and *drawLine*) there is an equivalent _fill_ function that takes the same arguments. As the name may say, a _fill_ function fills the shape, while the _draw_ functions draws the outline. The fill functions are the following: _fillRect_, _fillTriangle_, _fillCircle_.

Input handling is done in the following way:
- You call _poolInputEvents_ or _detectInputEvent_. The difference between them is that _poolInputEvents_ returns a list of all the events detected in a frame, while _detectInputEvent_ returns the last event detected in the frame
- Each input event has four fields: its type, the key that was pressed, and if it was a mouse event, the current coordinates of the mouse pointer. The user can then use this information to handle each event.

The event types are the following:
- *KEYUP* - detects if the user stopped pressing a key
- *KEYDOWN* - detects if the user pressed a key
- *MOUSEUP* - detects if the user stopped pressing a mouse key
- *MOUSEDOWN* - detects if the user pressed a mouse key
- *MOUSEWHEEL* - detects if the user moved the mouse wheel
- *MOUSEMOTION* - detects if the user moved the mouse

Most keyboard and mouse keys are supported and their values are marked with the following aliases:
- KEY_UNKNOWN
- KEY_RETURN

### Setup
This project requires the following libraries:

- GLM: A header-only C++ mathematics library for graphics software.
- SDL3: The Simple DirectMedia Layer library for handling graphics, input, and audio.
- SDL3_ttf: An SDL extension for handling TrueType fonts.

Make sure to install these dependencies before building the project.

We used Trello in order to manage and organise our tasks during the development of the application. This is the [link](https://trello.com/b/ZR0p4Yfg/rasterizer) to our backlog creation.

# User stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

User story 1: As a Blender enthusiast, I want to import 3D models in common file formats so I can load and convert my designs without hassle.

User story 2: As a designer, I want to set the output resolution myself so I can ensure my images meet quality standards for client work.

User story 3: As a lighting artist, I want to tweak lighting settings so my rasterized scenes look dynamic and eye-catching.

User story 4: As a 3D animator, I want to switch between rendering modes to experiment with different visual styles for my portfolio.

User story 5: As a 3D enthusiast, I want to have simple command for different drawing shapes and have them displayed in a buffer for convenience.

User story 6: As a shader developer, I want to apply custom GLSL/HLSL shaders to add unique textures and effects to my models.

User story 7: As a virtual photographer, I want to adjust the cameraâ€™s position, angle, and zoom to frame my 3D scenes perfectly for renders.

User story 8: As a detail-focused tester, I want anti-aliasing enabled to eliminate jagged edges and ensure my final images look polished.

User story 9: As a freelancer with tight deadlines, I want a back face culling option before committing to a full render.

User story 10: As a game developer, I want GPU acceleration support to speed up rendering for complex models and large projects.

User story 11: As a newbie to 3D software, I want an intuitive interface with helpful tooltips so I can learn the app without getting overwhelmed.
